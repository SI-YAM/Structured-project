Vending Machine Program in C

This is a simple vending machine program written in C by Shopnil, Adhora, and Siyam. The program allows users to purchase items using cash or online payment (Bkash/Nagad). It displays a menu of available products with their prices and stock, lets users select an item, and processes the transaction accordingly. The program checks for sufficient funds in cash payments, provides change, and verifies stock availability. For online payments, it requests a mobile number before deducting the amount. The vending machine runs in a loop until the user decides to exit, ensuring smooth operation with proper input validation and error handling.
